# Polynomial Equation Evaluator in Cpp
As C++ does not have any inbuilt function to solve polynomial equation . I wrote a code to calculate polynomial equation at a given value of x for my college work .Looking forward for contiributions.

## Input format
Coeff0\*x\*x\*x..n+Coeff1\*x\*x\*x..(n-1)+Coeff2\*x\*x\*x..(n-2)+................+Coeff(N-2)\*x\*x\*x+Coeff(N-1)\*x+Coeff(N).<br>
Note- there should not be any space .<br>
Input format examples
1. x\*x-2\*x+1
2. 3\*x\*x-4.5\*x+3
3. 4.5\*x\*x\*x+3.5\*x\*x+2\*x-5

## Output interpretation
1. The line starting with Hooray gives the value of f(x) you entered at given value of variable (you entered)

## Usage in linux
1. git clone <br>
2. cd <directory> <br>
3. g++ file_name.cpp -o file_name <br>
4. ./file_name<br>
Note - here file_name will be solve_equation_using_split .
  
## Usage in Windows 
In windows you can I compile this file as you normally compile cpp file.
